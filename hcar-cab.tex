{\tt cab} is a MacPorts-like maintenance command of Haskell cabal packages.
Some parts of this program are a wrapper to {\tt ghc-pkg} and {\tt cabal}.

If you are always confused due to inconsistency of {\tt ghc-pkg} and {\tt
cabal}, or if you want a way to check all outdated packages, or if you want a
way to remove outdated packages recursively, this command helps you.

Since the last HCAR, nothing was changed.
